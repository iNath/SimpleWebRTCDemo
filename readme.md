It allows two windows to communicate some text to simply demonstrate how WebRTC can work.

To test it :
- open initiator.html
- open responder.html

And folow the instructions.

Enjoy !

Note:
- you can test it from two different pc on the same local network
- can't work through internet (firewall issues, to fix with ice, stun, turn, ...)
- tested on firefox successfully
- I didn't manage to make it work with chrome :(
